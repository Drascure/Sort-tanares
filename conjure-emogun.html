            You can call an aberrant creature of the penumbral plane
            to serve you. An aberration of challenge rating 5 or lower
            appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied
            space within 10 feet of it, creating a short distortion when
            it appears.
            The aberration is friendly to you and your companions
            for the duration. Roll initiative for the aberration, which
            has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you
            issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any
            commands to the aberration, it defends itself from hostile
            creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
            If your concentration is broken, the aberration doesn’t
            disappear. Instead, you lose control of the aberration, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might
            attack. An uncontrolled aberration can’t be dismissed by you,
            and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
