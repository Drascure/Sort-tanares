            You conjure a green cloud that forms in the sky and small
            drops of corrosive acid fall from it, affecting a circular area
            of 30-foot radius in the range. All creatures that will start
            their turn or enter the affected area must make a Constitution
            save. On a failure the creature takes 2d8 acid damage, or
            half this damage on a success. Objects not being carried and
            structures in the affected area, take double damage.
