            You conjure five small energy spheres in range, each about
            half a meter in diameter, spinning at high speed and affecting
            a spherical area with a diameter of 10 feet. Any creature that
            starts its turn or enters the area takes 3d6 force damage, or
            half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. As a
            bonus action, you can move the spheres together 20 feet in
            any direction within the spellâ€™s range, changing the location
            of the sphere and its effect
