            When you cast this spell, you can make 1 to 20 arrows magically enchanted for the duration, making a special magical
            bond with each of them. You make any ranged attack using
            these arrows with advantage, as well as ignoring half cover
            and Â¾ cover that protects the target of this attack. Also,
            for the duration of the spell, you always know where your
            enchanted arrows are, as well as you can use your action to
            magically see through one of those arrows of your choice,
            and continue to do so until you use your action to return
            to your normal senses. As long as you are seeing through
            the arrow, you are blind to your own senses. You will not
            be able to see through one of its arrows if it is more than 1
            mile away from you. If one of these arrows breaks, the enchantment no longer affects it.
