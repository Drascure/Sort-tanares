            You shoot a spectral arrow establishing a connection between two humanoid creatures within range (you can target
            yourself). Unwilling creatures must succeed on a Wisdom
            saving throw or be affected by the arrow.
            You may make one or both of the affected creatures to
            become charmed by the other targeted creature (even if that
            second creature succeeded on its save). This can cause two
            creatures to become charmed by each other, or one creature
            to be charmed by the other, at your choice<br>
            <strong><i>At Higher Levels.</i></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell
            slot of 5th level or higher you can charm any creature, not
            only humanoids.
