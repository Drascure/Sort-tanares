            You create a number of small magic mirrors, equal to your
            spellcasting ability modifier, about half a foot square each,
            distributing them anywhere within range of the spell. Mirrors
            are invisible, but can be seen through spells such as Detect
            Magic, or by creatures that have true sight, or the like.<br> You,
            and any creature you allow, are able to see the mirrors.<br> When
            a creature that can see the mirrors is adjacent to one of them,
            it will be able to see through it as if it were positioned where
            any of them are.<br>
            In addition, spellcasters who can see the mirrors, and are
            adjacent to any of them, can cast their spells as if they were
            positioned at the location of any of those mirrors. The spell
            cast in this way cannot be touched. Creatures that are in
            spaces adjacent to the space occupied by one of the mirrors
            can sense their presence with a successful DC 18 Wisdom
            (Perception) check.
            The mirrors have 5 hp, 13 AC.
