            You become a catalyst of envy, pulling the luck of an enemy
            towards you. When an enemy you can see makes a roll, such 
            as an attack or a saving throw, the target must succeed on a
            Charisma check. If they fail, you steal that result and store it.
            If you do so, the target must reroll the dice that was stolen.
            While maintaining concentration, you can spend the
            stolen value as one of your own rolls, thus ending the effect of the spell.
