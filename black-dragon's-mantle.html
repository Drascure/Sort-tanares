            You infuse the body of a willing creature you touch with
            black flames that cover its entire body. Target creature is
            resistant to fire and necrotic damage. Any other creature
            that touches the target creature takes 1d6 fire damage + 1d6
            necrotic damage. If the target creature takes damage from
            melee attacks, for each attack made, the attacking creature
            must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or take damage
            as if it had touched the target creature. In addition, melee
            attacks made by the target creature also deal touch damage
            as a bonus to your damage.
