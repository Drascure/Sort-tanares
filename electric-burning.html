            You create a cone of energy that extends 30 feet from the
            palm of your hand. All creatures within the area must make
            a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes
            4d6 lightning damage plus 1d6 lightning damage per target
            that failed in saving throws or, on a successful one, half as
            much damage.
