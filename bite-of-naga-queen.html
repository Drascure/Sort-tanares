            You transform one of your arms into a serpent, allowing
            you to make a melee spell attack against a creature within
            10ft of you. On a hit, the target takes piercing damage equal
            to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier and must make
            a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is
            poisoned, taking 10d8 poison damage and staying in the
            poisoned condition. On a successful, the creature takes half
            the poison damage and is not poisoned. Alternatively, you
            can spit the poison in a 10-foot cone, starting up to 10ft from
            you, and all creatures in the area must make a Constitution
            save. On a failed save, they take 6d8 poison damage and are
            poisoned, taking 1d6 poison damage at the start of their
            turns. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
            turn, ending the condition on a success. Creatures poisoned
            by this spell cannot be affected by it again until they complete a long rest.
