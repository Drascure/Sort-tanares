            Choose a spell you are able to cast that is up to 4th level.
            You can grant a creature within the spell’s range the ability
            to cast this spell once, within this spell’s duration. The target
            creature uses its wisdom as the spellcasting ability for this
            spell and must spend the action normally used to cast it.
