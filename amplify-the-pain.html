            You concentrate and gaze upon a creature within range, causing all of the pain it receives to be amplified for the duration
            of the spell. Whenever the target takes damage, it must make
            a Constitution saving throw or take an additional 1d8 damage. If this additional damage reduces the targetâ€™s hit points
            to 10 or fewer, it must make a Strength saving throw or drop
            anything it is holding on a failed save
