            You create a fixed, 10 feet high, spiritual banner at one location, with a symbol you are currently defending, allies within
            a 60-foot-radius circular area who can see the banner are
            inspired, and for the next 10 minutes, can add 1d6 to one
            ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Each ally can only
            use this extra die once, ending this effect for them after it is
            used. For all purposes, this die counts as a bardic inspiration
            die. This spell can only be cast once every 8 hours.
