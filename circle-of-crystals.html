            line of sight and within range of this spell become resistant
            to 2 types of damage, your choice of bludgeoning, slashing,
            piercing, acid, lightning, fire, cold, necrotic, rumbling and
            poisonous. If one of the affected creatures is already resistant to the chosen damage type, it becomes immune to that
