            You create six wings composed of condensed divine energy
            that rise from your back. The wings grant you a flying speed of
            50 feet for the duration of the spell. Wings have great powers
            and using an action you can perform the following effects:<br>
            <strong><i>Winds of Mercy.</i></strong> You create an enormous gust of healing energy. All creatures in the area of a 30-foot cone heal for 4d10.<br>
            <strong><i>Winds of Vengeance.</i></strong> The wings emit a strong pulse of
            energy that affects a 30-foot-radius sphere from you, hostile
            creatures in the area take 4d10 radiant damage. As a reaction, you can make the wings defend your body by folding
            around it. If you react to an attack, you can add 10 to your
            AC at the start of your next turn. If you react to a spell, you
            gain advantage on the saving throw, or the bonus to your
            AC, if the spell requires an attack roll.
