            When you cast this spell, you instill in you and your allies
            the spirit of the arena. You and every willing ally within its
            20ft of you has advantage on strength checks, strength saving throws and all saving throws against effects that cause
            the frightened condition. While a creature has this effect
            active, they deal +2 on all damage rolls they make, including attacks and spells, the bonus is applied to each damage
            caused individually before any other modifier.
