            You manipulate reality to create an echoing effect. As a reaction to the end of another creatureâ€™s turn, you can cast this
            spell to replicate the effects of their previous turn. To use this
            spell, you must have witnessed the events of that turn within
            your line of sight. The replicated effects include spellcasting,
            attacks, hits, damage, and the results of saving throws and
            ability checks. All targets remain the same, and any attacks
            or effects that become impossible, such as a target moving
            out of reach, will simply not occur. No additional dice rolls
            or checks are required, and the results of the replicated actions remain unchanged.<br> <br>
            It is important to note that casting Echoing does not incur
            any additional costs or expenses, such as consuming spell
            slots or expending resources from abilities or spells. However,
            if the original action had any side effects on the caster, such
            as those caused by a wish spell, you will experience these
            side effects instead of the original creature, as if you had
            performed those actions yourself.
