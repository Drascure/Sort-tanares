            When you cast this spell, you create an aura around you
            that affects a 20-foot-radius circular area. Your allies who
            start their turns within the area regain hit points equal to
            1d6 + your proficiency bonus. Also, any conditions that are
            affecting creatures within the area no longer affect it at the
            start of your turn. Lasting effects or conditions do not cease
            to affect the creature, but are only suspended for the duration of the spell.
